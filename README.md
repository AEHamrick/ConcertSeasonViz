## ConcertSeasonViz

This repository is an in-progress proof of concept series of Python scripts with accompanying documentation that can be used to assemble a selection of artists from a curated music library (iTunes used as a test case) and retrieve information about each artist, its discography, and past touring behavior. The end goal is to reformat this information into a databse or tabular dataset for consumption by Tableau or R in order to visualize trends. Please see the Docs folder for more information.

Analyses I have in mind to explore include seasonality of touring or album releases and likelihood of repeat performances in a state or venue.
